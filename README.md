# F_t-and-F_max
f_max (Maximum Oscillation Frequency / Unity Power Gain Frequency)

Definition: f_max is the frequency at which the maximum available power gain (MAG or Mason's unilateral gain U) drops to 1 (0 dB). \
At f_max, the transistor can no longer provide power amplification (output power ≤ input power) even under ideal conjugate matching conditions at both input and output.
